# **Taproom**

## **Project Description**

This phase one of a two-week project that I created to help further my knowledge with ReactJS fundamentals and components. This one-page application was created so the user could keep an inventory off all the beers they have on tap and a place to store that beer's information. Below you will find a number of user stories to better describe the features of this application.


| ID | User Story | Accepted |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| US01 | "As a user, I want to see a list of all available beers. For each beer, I want to see its name, brand, price, pints, and alcohol content."| True |
| US02 | "As the user, I want to submit a form to add a new beer to the beer list."| True |
| US03 | "As the user, I want to be able to click on a beer to see it's detail page." | True |
| US04 | "As the user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg." | True |
| US05 | "As the user, I want to be able to click a button to 'buy' a pint whenever one is sold. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0." | True |
